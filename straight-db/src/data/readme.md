#The Data Directory

Place any sql dumps here and they will be imported the next time the project is provisioned. After importing, your .sql file will be renamed with a .imported extension. This will prevent it from being re-imported next time you run `vagrant provision`. If you would like to re-import, simply remove the .imported extension. To import a new database set, just drop the .sql file into this folder. Note that the new data will completely replace the old data.
